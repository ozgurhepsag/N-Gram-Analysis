# N-Gram Analysis

### Task

Implement an n-gram algorithm (for 1,2 and 3-grams), and test it on a part of Turkish Novel Corpus, which includes 5 novels. 

NGram, NGramDictionary and NGramExtractor classes have been taken from [Nuve](https://github.com/hrzafer/nuve/tree/master/nuve/NGrams) repository for this project. Some little changes have been made on those classes.
